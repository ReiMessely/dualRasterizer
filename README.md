# DualRasterizer

This repository is made during my time studying Game Development in Digital Arts and Entertainment (DAE) in Kortrijk (Belgium) In this project I learned on how to write a rasterizer. This was a part of Graphics Programming 1.
The project combines both the [software rasterizer](https://github.com/Wardergrip/rasterizer) and [hardware rasterizer](https://github.com/Wardergrip/rasterizerDirectX).
The light blue blackground indicates that what you're currently viewing is the hardware version (a.k.a. directX version).
